# Shellhacks-2022-Vanguard-Challenge

## Inspiration
Family is one of the most important things to hispanic families. Considering that I myself am hispanic and I also have a large family, I figured it made sense to make an application in which I could track close family and friend credentials so that I could never forget to give them a "Happy Birthday!" call, text or email!

## What it does
Stores family/friend credentials. Provides a function to determine how many day's until any family/friend members birthday.

## How we built it
With the use of Python

## Challenges we ran into
Dealing with arithmetic on dates. Learning to use Git repo. Handling Boolean logic. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Worked on this project for a total of 8-9h. It might be basic but it is my first real attempt at a timed project ever since I began teaching myself.

## What we learned
I learned to how to preplan my project, how to brainstorm on ideas, how to use Git repo

## What's next for Birthday Tracker
Adding more features and potentially a frontend UI
